  ## Description
 
  This is my devloper portfolio site, it links to several of my repositories and deployed projects.

  ## Installation

  You can run the site locally by cloning the project. Once downloaded, navigate to the project directory in the terminal and type `npm i` assuming you have npm installed on your computer. This will install all dependancies for react in order to run the site. Then, you should be able to start the react server locally by typing `npm start` in the terminal.

  ## Usage

  > I will be using this site as a businiss card, where interested parties can learn a bit about me and see some of the projects that I have worked on.
